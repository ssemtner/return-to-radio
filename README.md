This is a quick website to show off our school's radio play performances.
I decided to build it in react and next.js because I wanted to get more experiance using them even if it is overkill.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Next.js
- Ant Design


## How to Run

```bash
# Developement Server
npm run dev

# Build
npm run start

# Start
npm run build
```
